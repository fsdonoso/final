Comment on website: When logged in, you can (preferably after letting load for a few seconds) select a stock in the drop-down menu on the right. When selected, stock information will be rendered. Additionally, dates can be selected in the menu on the right (won't work with future dates) and then the "Get change info" button pressed to get more statistics on selected stock.

Stocks can be added to a user-specific watchlist and each user can give 1 Like for the app. When re-logged in the user-specific watchlist will be shown with latest data and the total number of likes of all users.
